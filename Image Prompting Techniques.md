# 🎨 Text-to-Image Prompting Techniques
*Enhance AI-generated visuals through expert prompting strategies*

## 📅 Description
This guide outlines essential techniques for crafting high-quality prompts to generate compelling images using generative AI models such as DALL·E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion. Whether you're aiming for realism, surrealism, or stylized art, these techniques will help you influence the model output more effectively.

## 💭 Technique 1: Style Modifiers
Use specific terms to define artistic characteristics, such as:
- Art style: *"in the style of watercolor painting"*
- Historical period: *"Renaissance-inspired"*
- Medium: *"oil on canvas"*
- Brand/aesthetic references: *"Studio Ghibli style"*

### ✅ Example Prompt:
```
a sunset over a mountain range in the style of watercolor painting by Monet
```

---

## 🎥 Technique 2: Quality Boosters
Enhance visual clarity, resolution, and detail with descriptors like:
- high resolution, 4k, ultra-HD
- hyper-detailed, cinematic lighting
- crisp details, soft focus

### ✅ Example Prompt:
```
a futuristic city skyline at night, 4k resolution, sharp detail, glowing lights, deep shadows
```

---

## ♻️ Technique 3: Repetition
Repeat key adjectives or nouns to emphasize focus:

### ✅ Example Prompt:
```
a tiny, tiny, tiny glowing fairy in a dense, dense, dense forest
```

---

## ⚖️ Technique 4: Weighted Terms
Assign emphasis with weights (if supported by the model):
- warm: +10, shimmering: +6
- exotic: +10, colorful: -6 (deprioritize)

Use emotion-based or luxury-related terms to heighten desirability.

## ❌ Technique 5: Fix Deformed Generations
Combat anatomical and visual distortions using **negative prompts**:
- disfigured, deformed hands, blurry, bad anatomy, low quality

Apply these especially when generating realistic human figures.

## 🔚 Summary
These five techniques can dramatically improve the output of AI image generators:

1. **Style Modifiers**: Define art direction clearly
2. **Quality Boosters**: Add detail and resolution
3. **Repetition**: Reinforce thematic focus
4. **Weighted Terms**: Emphasize or downplay elements
5. **Negative Prompts**: Prevent visual errors

> ✨ Effective prompting transforms ideas into stunning AI-generated images.
