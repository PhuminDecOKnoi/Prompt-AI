# 🧩 Structured Prompting: Interview Pattern & Chain-of-Thought  
*Enhancing LLM output through dialogue-driven and logic-sequenced prompts*

## 📌 Description
This guide introduces two advanced prompting strategies for large language models (LLMs): the Interview Pattern and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach. These techniques enable more interactive, contextual, and logic-driven outputs from generative AI models by mimicking human-like reasoning or structured dialogues.

Ideal for prompt engineers, AI trainers, and educators, this template can be used to build more responsive and customized AI applications across domains such as customer service, travel planning, and tutoring.

## 🗣️ Technique 1: Interview Pattern Approach

### 🔍 Definition:
A prompt strategy that simulates an interview, guiding the LLM to ask questions first before generating a response.

### 🎯 Goal:
To gather personalized input step-by-step from the user, allowing the AI to create highly tailored output based on real-time answers.

### ✅ Example Prompt:

### 🧠 Expected Behavior:
- The model begins asking:  
  “What type of destinations do you prefer—beaches, mountains, or cities?”  
  … and continues based on answers.

## 🔗 Technique 2: Chain-of-Thought Prompting

### 🔍 Definition:
A prompting technique where the model is shown example problems with **step-by-step solutions** to help it reason logically.

### 🎯 Goal:
To guide the model in applying the same reasoning process to new but similar problems.

### ✅ Example Prompt:

Then follow up with a similar question:  
“Matthew has 6 eggs and buys two dozen more. How many does he have now?”

### 🧠 Expected Behavior:
- The model mimics the explanation pattern:  
  6 + (2 × 12) = 30 eggs

## 🔚 Conclusion
Both Interview Pattern and Chain-of-Thought prompting enhance the model’s ability to:
- Gather user-specific data through interaction (Interview Pattern)
- Demonstrate structured, multi-step reasoning (CoT)

These approaches support more transparent, user-aligned, and consistent outputs from LLMs.

> ✨ Prompting isn’t just asking — it’s designing conversations and thought flows.
